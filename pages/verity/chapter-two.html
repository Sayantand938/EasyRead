I was at my desk, watching an ant crawl across my big toe.</p><p>The ant was alone, moving back and forth, searching for food or friends. He seemed confused by being alone. Or maybe he was excited about being free. I wondered why he was by himself. Ants usually travel in groups.</p><p>The fact that I was so curious about the ant was a clear sign I needed to leave my apartment. I was worried that, after being stuck inside caring for my mother for so long, I’d be just as confused as that ant once I stepped into the hallway. Left, right, inside, outside, <em>where are my friends, where is the food?</em></p><p>The ant crawled off my toe and onto the floor. He disappeared under the wall when Corey’s texts came through.</p><p>I was hoping he’d understand when I drew a line months ago: since we&#39;re no longer intimate, the best way for a literary agent and his author to communicate is by email.</p><p>His text said: <em>Meet me tomorrow morning at nine at the Pantem Press building, 14th floor. I think we might have an offer.</em></p><p>He didn’t even ask about my mom. I wasn’t surprised. His lack of interest in anything but his job and himself is why we&#39;re no longer together. His lack of concern made me feel unfairly annoyed. He doesn’t owe me anything, but he could have at least acted like he cared.</p><p>I didn’t text him back at all last night. Instead, I put down my phone and stared at the crack in the wall—where the ant had disappeared. I wondered if he would find other ants in the wall, or if he was a loner. Maybe he was like me and didn&#39;t like other ants.</p><p>It’s hard to say why I dislike other people so much, but if I had to guess, I’d say it’s because my own mother was scared of me.</p><p><em>Scared</em> might be too strong. But she definitely didn’t trust me as a kid. She kept me away from people outside of school because she was afraid of what I might do during my sleepwalking episodes. That fear carried over into my adulthood, and by then, I was set in my ways. A loner. Very few friends and not much of a social life. Which is why this is the first morning I’ve left my apartment since before she passed away.</p><p>I thought my first trip out of my apartment would be to a place I missed, like Central Park or a bookstore.</p><p>I definitely didn’t think I&#39;d be here, standing in line in a publishing house lobby, praying this job offer will help me catch up on rent so I won’t be kicked out. But here I am, one meeting away from either being homeless or getting a job that will let me find a new place.</p><p>I look down and smooth the white shirt Jeremy lent me in the bathroom across the street. I hope I don’t look too silly. Maybe I can make it look like wearing men’s shirts twice my size is a cool new trend.</p><p>“Nice shirt,” someone behind me says.</p><p>I turn around, surprised to see Jeremy.</p><p><em>Is he following me?</em></p><p>It’s my turn in line, so I give the security guard my driver’s license and look at Jeremy, noticing his new shirt. “Do you carry extra shirts in your pocket?” It hasn’t been that long since he gave me the one he was wearing.</p><p>“My hotel is a block away. I went back to change.”</p><p>His hotel. That’s good. If he’s staying in a hotel, maybe he doesn’t work here. And if he doesn’t work here, maybe he’s not in publishing. I’m not sure why I don’t want him to be in publishing. I just don&#39;t know who I&#39;m meeting with, and I hope it’s not him after this morning. “So you don’t work in this building?”</p><p>He takes out his ID and gives it to the security guard. “No, I don’t work here. I have a meeting on the fourteenth floor.”</p><p>&quot;Of course, he does.&quot;</p><p>“Me too,” I say.</p><p>He smiles briefly, then it vanishes, like he remembered what happened across the street and knows it&#39;s too soon to be unaffected. “What are the odds we’re going to the same meeting?” He takes his ID back from the guard, who points us toward the elevators.</p><p>“I don’t know,” I say. “I haven’t been told exactly why I’m here yet.” We get on the elevator, and he presses the button for the fourteenth floor. He faces me as he takes his tie out of his pocket and starts putting it on.</p><p>I can’t stop looking at his wedding ring.</p><p>“Are you a writer?” he asks.</p><p>I nod. “Are you?”</p><p>“No. My wife is.” He adjusts his tie until it’s in place. “Have you written anything I would know?”</p><p>“I doubt it. No one reads my books.”</p><p>He smiles a little. “There aren’t many Lowens in the world. I bet I can figure out which books you’ve written.”</p><p><em>Why? Does he really want to read them?</em> He glances down at his phone and starts typing.</p><p>“I never said I write under my real name.”</p><p>He doesn’t look up from his phone until the elevator doors open. He walks toward them, then turns to face me as he steps out. He holds up his phone and smiles. “You don’t write under a pen name. You write under Lowen Ashleigh, which, oddly enough, is the name of the author I’m meeting at nine thirty.”</p><p><em>I finally see that smile, and as beautiful as it is, I don’t want it anymore.</em></p><p>He just Googled me. And even though my meeting is at nine, not nine thirty, he seems to know more about it than I do. If we&#39;re really going to the same meeting, our chance meeting on the street seems a little suspicious. But I guess the odds of us both being in the same place at the same time aren’t that unbelievable, since we were going in the same direction to the same meeting, and therefore, saw the same accident.</p><p>Jeremy steps aside, and I leave the elevator. I start to say something, but he takes a few steps, walking backward. “See you in a bit.”</p><p>I don’t know him at all, or how he fits into the meeting I’m about to have. But even without knowing any details of what’s happening this morning, I can’t help but like him. The guy literally gave me the shirt off his back, so I doubt he&#39;s the type to hold a grudge.</p><p>I smile before he turns the corner. “Alright. See you in a bit.”</p><p>He smiles back. “Alright.”</p><p>I watch him until he turns left and is gone. As soon as he can’t see me anymore, I relax a little. This morning has just been... a lot. Between the accident I saw and being in small spaces with that confusing man, I’m feeling so strange. I press my palm against the wall and lean into it. What the heck—</p><p>“You’re on time,” Corey says. His voice makes me jump. I turn around and see him walking toward me from the other hallway. He leans in and kisses my cheek. I freeze up.</p><p>“You’re never on time.”</p><p>“I would have been here earlier, but…” I stop talking. I don’t explain why I wasn’t early. He doesn’t seem interested as he walks in the same direction as Jeremy.</p><p>“The meeting doesn’t really start until nine thirty, but I thought you’d be late, so I told you nine.”</p><p>I stop, looking at the back of his head. <em>What the heck, Corey?</em> If he had told me nine thirty instead of nine, I wouldn’t have seen the accident across the street. I wouldn’t have had to see a stranger’s blood.</p><p>“You coming?” Corey asks, stopping to look back at me.</p><p>I try to hide my annoyance. I’m used to doing that with him.</p><p>We get to an empty conference room. Corey closes the door behind us, and I sit down at the conference table. He sits next to me at the head of the table, turning so he’s looking right at me. I try not to frown as I look at him after not seeing him for months, but he hasn’t changed. Still very neat, well-groomed, wearing a tie, glasses, a smile. He&#39;s always so different from me.</p><p>“You look terrible.” I say it because he doesn’t look terrible. He never does, and he knows it.</p><p>“You look rested and beautiful.” He says it because I never look rested and beautiful. I always look tired, and maybe even always bored. I’ve heard of Resting Bitch Face, but I&#39;m more like Resting Bored Face.</p><p>“How’s your mother?”</p><p>“She died last week.”</p><p>He wasn’t expecting that. He leans back in his chair and tilts his head. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p><em>Why haven’t you bothered to ask until now?</em> I shrug. “I’m still dealing with it.”</p><p>My mother had been living with me for the last nine months—ever since she was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer. She passed away last Wednesday after being in hospice for three months. It was hard to leave the apartment in those last few months because she depended on me for everything—from drinking, to eating, to turning over in her bed. When she got worse, I couldn’t leave her alone at all, which is why I didn’t leave my apartment for weeks. Luckily, having Wi-Fi and a credit card makes it easy to live completely indoors in Manhattan. You can get anything and everything you need delivered.</p><p>It’s funny how one of the most crowded cities in the world can also be a great place for people who are afraid to go outside.</p><p>“You okay?” Corey asks.</p><p>I hide how I really feel with a smile, even if he’s just asking to be polite. “I’m fine. It helps that it was expected.” I’m just saying what I think he wants to hear. I’m not sure how he’d react to the truth—that I’m glad she’s gone. My mother only ever made me feel guilty. Nothing else. Just constant guilt.</p><p>Corey goes to the counter with breakfast pastries, bottles of water, and a coffee pot. “You hungry? Thirsty?”</p><p>“Water’s fine.”</p><p>He grabs two waters and hands one to me, then goes back to his seat. &quot;Do you need help with the will? I&#39;m sure Edward can help.&quot;</p><p>Edward is the lawyer at Corey&#39;s literary agency. It&#39;s a small agency, so many of the writers use Edward&#39;s help with other things, too. Sadly, I won&#39;t be needing it. Corey tried to tell me when I signed the lease on my two-bedroom last year that I wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it. But my mother insisted she die with dignity—in her own room. Not in a nursing home. Not in a hospital. Not in a hospital bed in the middle of my small apartment. She wanted her own bedroom with her own things.</p><p>She promised that what was left in her bank account after she died would help me make up for all the time off I had to take from my writing. For the past year, I&#39;ve been living off the little bit of money I had left over from my last book deal. But it&#39;s all gone now, and apparently, so is my mother&#39;s money. It was one of the last things she told me before she finally died from the cancer. I would have cared for her no matter what her money situation was. She was my mother. But the fact that she felt she needed to lie to me so I would agree to take her in shows how distant we were from each other.</p><p>I take a sip of my water and then shake my head. &quot;I don&#39;t really need a lawyer. All she left me was debt, but thanks for the offer.&quot;</p><p>Corey tightens his lips. He knows I don&#39;t have much money because, as my agent, he&#39;s the one who sends me my royalty checks. Which is why he&#39;s looking at me with pity now. &quot;You have a royalty check coming soon from overseas,&quot; he says, as if I don&#39;t know about every penny coming my way for the next six months. As if I haven&#39;t already spent it.</p><p>&quot;I know. I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; I don&#39;t want to talk about my money problems with Corey. Or with anyone.</p><p>Corey shrugs a little, not convinced. He looks down and straightens his tie. &quot;Hopefully this offer will be good for both of us,&quot; he says.</p><p>I&#39;m glad the subject is changing. &quot;Why are we meeting in person with a publisher? You know I prefer to do things over email.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They asked for the meeting yesterday. Said they have a job they want to talk to you about, but they wouldn&#39;t give me any details over the phone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought you were trying to get another deal with my last publisher.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your books are doing okay, but not good enough to get another contract without you putting in more effort. You&#39;ll need to use social media, go on tour, and build a fan base. Your sales alone aren’t enough in today&#39;s market.”</p><p>This was what I feared. Getting my contract renewed with my current publisher was the only financial hope I had left. The royalty checks from my previous books have shrunk as my book sales have declined. I haven’t written much this past year because I’ve been taking care of my mother, so I have nothing to sell to a publisher.</p><p>“I don’t know what Pantem will offer, or if you&#39;ll even be interested,” Corey says. “We have to sign an agreement to keep things confidential before they give us more information. The secrecy makes me curious, though. I’m trying not to get too excited, but there are many possibilities, and I have a good feeling. We really need this.”</p><p>He says &quot;we&quot; because he gets fifteen percent of whatever they offer if I accept. That&#39;s the standard for agents. What&#39;s not standard is the six months we were in a relationship and the two years of sex after we broke up.</p><p>Our sexual relationship lasted as long as it did only because he wasn&#39;t serious about anyone else, and neither was I. It was convenient until it wasn&#39;t. But the reason our actual relationship was so short is because he was in love with another woman.</p><p><em>Except that the other woman in our relationship was also me.</em></p><p>It must be confusing to fall in love with a writer’s words before meeting the writer. Some people find it hard to separate a character from the person who created them. Surprisingly, Corey is one of those people, even though he’s a literary agent. He met and fell in love with the main female character in my first novel, Open Ended, before he ever spoke to me. He thought my character’s personality was similar to mine, but I couldn&#39;t be more different from her.</p><p>Corey was the only agent who responded to my query, and even that took months. His email was only a few sentences long, but it was enough to give me hope again.</p><p><em>I read your book, Open Ended, in just a few hours. I believe in this book. If you’re still looking for an agent, give me a call.</em></p><p>His email came on a Thursday morning. We had a long phone conversation about my book two hours later. By Friday afternoon, we had met for coffee and signed a contract.</p><p>By Saturday night, we&#39;d had sex three times.</p><p>I&#39;m sure our relationship crossed some ethical lines, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s why it didn&#39;t last. Once Corey understood that I wasn&#39;t like the character I played, he saw we weren&#39;t a good match. I wasn&#39;t heroic. I wasn&#39;t simple. I was complicated. An emotional challenge he didn&#39;t want to deal with.</p><p>Which was okay. I wasn&#39;t looking to be figured out.</p><p>Even though being with him was difficult, being his client is surprisingly easy. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t switch agencies after we broke up; he&#39;s always been fair and supportive when it comes to my career.</p><p>&quot;You seem a little stressed,&quot; Corey says, snapping me out of my thoughts. &quot;Are you nervous?&quot;</p><p>I nod, hoping he&#39;ll think I&#39;m just nervous because I don&#39;t want to explain why I&#39;m stressed. It&#39;s only been two hours since I left my apartment this morning, but it feels like more has happened in those two hours than in the whole rest of the year. I look down at my hands...my arms...checking for any signs of blood. It&#39;s gone now, but I can still feel it. <em>Smell</em> it.</p><p>My hands are still shaking, so I keep hiding them under the table. Now that I&#39;m here, I&#39;m thinking I probably shouldn&#39;t have come. But I can&#39;t pass up a possible job. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m getting tons of offers, and if I don&#39;t get something soon, I&#39;ll have to get a regular job. If I get a regular job, I&#39;ll barely have time to write. But at least I&#39;ll be able to pay my bills.</p><p>Corey takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes the sweat from his forehead. He only sweats when he&#39;s nervous. Him being nervous is making me even more nervous now. &quot;Do we need a secret signal if you don&#39;t like the offer?&quot; he asks.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s hear what they have to say first, and then we can ask to talk alone.&quot;</p><p>Corey clicks his pen and sits up straight in his chair like he&#39;s getting ready for a fight. &quot;Let me do the talking.&quot;</p><p>I was planning to anyway. He&#39;s so likable and charming. I doubt I could find anyone who would describe me that way. It&#39;s best if I just listen.</p><p>“What are you <em>wearing</em>?” Corey is staring at my shirt, confused, only noticing it now after being with me for fifteen minutes.</p><p>I look down at my big shirt. I almost forgot how silly I look. “I spilled coffee on my other shirt this morning and had to change.”</p><p>“Whose shirt is that?”</p><p>I shrug. “Probably yours. It was in my closet.”</p><p>“You left the house wearing that? You couldn’t find something else to wear?”</p><p>“Doesn’t it look stylish?” I&#39;m being sarcastic, but he doesn&#39;t get it.</p><p>He makes a face. “No. Is it supposed to?”</p><p><em>Such a jerk.</em> But he’s good in bed, like most jerks.</p><p>I’m actually glad when the conference room door opens and a woman walks in. She’s followed, almost like a joke, by an older man walking so close behind her that he bumps into her when she stops.</p><p>&quot;Goddammit, Barron,&quot; I hear her mutter.</p><p>I almost smile thinking about &quot;Goddammit Barron&quot; actually being his name.</p><p>Jeremy comes in last. He gives me a small nod that no one else notices.</p><p>The woman is dressed better than I ever am, with short black hair and lipstick so red, it&#39;s a bit much at nine thirty in the morning. She seems to be the boss as she reaches for Corey&#39;s hand, and then mine, while Goddammit Barron watches. &quot;Amanda Thomas,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;m an editor with Pantem Press. This is Barron Stephens, our lawyer, and Jeremy Crawford, our client.&quot;</p><p>Jeremy and I shake hands, and he does a good job of acting like we didn&#39;t share a really weird morning. He quietly sits across from me. I try not to look at him, but that&#39;s where my eyes keep going. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m more curious about him than I am about this meeting.</p><p>Amanda pulls folders out of her briefcase and slides them in front of Corey and me.</p><p>&quot;Thank you for meeting with us,&quot; she says. &quot;We don&#39;t want to waste your time, so I&#39;ll get straight to the point. One of our authors can&#39;t finish a contract because of health problems, and we&#39;re looking for a writer with experience in the same type of book who might want to finish the three books left in her series.&quot;</p><p>I look at Jeremy, but his serious face doesn&#39;t give away his part in this meeting.</p><p>&quot;Who is the author?&quot; Corey asks.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re happy to share the details and conditions with you, but we need you to sign this agreement to keep things private. We want to keep our author&#39;s current situation out of the news.&quot;</p><p>“Of course,” Corey says.</p><p>I agree, but I don&#39;t say anything as we both look over the forms and then sign them. Corey slides them back to Amanda.</p><p>“Her name is Verity Crawford,” she says. “I’m sure you know her work.”</p><p>Corey gets tense as soon as Verity’s name is mentioned. Of course we know her work. Everyone does. I glance at Jeremy. Is Verity his wife? They have the same last name. He said his wife is a writer. But why would he be in a meeting about her? A meeting she isn’t even at?</p><p>“We know the name,” Corey says, being careful with his words.</p><p>“Verity has a very popular series that we don’t want to see left unfinished,” Amanda continues. “Our goal is to find a writer who will step in, finish the series, do the book tours, press releases, and everything else Verity normally does. We plan to release a press release introducing the new co-writer while also keeping Verity’s privacy as much as possible.”</p><p>Book tours? Press releases?</p><p>Corey is looking at me now. He knows I’m not okay with that part. Many authors are great at talking with readers, but I&#39;m so awkward that I’m afraid if my readers meet me, they’ll never read my books again. I’ve only done one signing, and I didn’t sleep the week before. I was so scared during the signing that it was hard to talk. The next day, I got an email from a reader who said I was a stuck-up person and she’d never read my books again.</p><p>And that’s why I stay home and write. I think the idea of me is better than the real me.</p><p>Corey says nothing as he opens the folder Amanda gives him. “What is Mrs. Crawford’s pay for three novels?”</p><p>Damn it, Barron answers the question. “Verity’s contract terms with her publisher will stay the same and, of course, won’t be shared. All royalties will go to Verity. But my client, Jeremy Crawford, is willing to offer a set payment of seventy-five thousand dollars per book.”</p><p>My stomach jumps at the thought of that kind of money. But as quickly as the excitement lifts me up, I feel down again when I realize how huge this all is. Going from being an unknown writer to co-author of a popular series is too big of a step for me. I can already feel my anxiety kicking in just thinking about it.</p><p>Corey leans forward, crossing his arms on the table. “I’m guessing the pay can be discussed.”</p><p>I try to get Corey’s attention. I want to tell him that we don&#39;t need to negotiate. There’s no way I’m accepting an offer to finish a series of books that I’d be too nervous to write.</p><p>Damn it, Barron sits up straighter in his chair. “With all respect, Verity Crawford has spent the past thirteen years building her brand. A brand that wouldn’t be here otherwise. The offer is for three books. Seventy-five thousand dollars per book, which adds up to a total of two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars.”</p><p>Corey drops a pen on the table, leaning back in his chair and looking like he’s not impressed. “What’s the deadline for turning them in?”</p><p>“We’re already behind, so we want the first book turned in six months from when the contract is signed.”</p><p>I can’t stop looking at the red lipstick smeared on her teeth as she talks.</p><p>“The timing for the other two is open for discussion. Ideally, we’d like the contract finished in the next twenty-four months.”</p><p>I can tell Corey is doing the math in his head. It makes me wonder if he’s figuring out what his cut would be, or what <em>my</em> cut would be. Corey would get fifteen percent. That’s almost thirty-four thousand dollars, just for being my agent at this meeting. Half would go to taxes. That’s just under one hundred thousand that would end up in my bank account. Fifty grand a year.</p><p>It&#39;s more than double the money I got for my last books, but it&#39;s not enough to make me want to join such a popular series. The conversation goes back and forth without really going anywhere, because I already know I&#39;m going to say no. When Amanda pulls out the official contract, I clear my throat and start to talk.</p><p>“I appreciate the offer,” I say. I look right at Jeremy so he knows I mean it. “I really do. But if you&#39;re planning to bring in someone to be the new face of the series, I&#39;m sure there are other writers who would be a much better choice.”</p><p>Jeremy doesn&#39;t say anything, but he&#39;s looking at me with a lot more interest than he was before I spoke. I stand up, ready to leave. I&#39;m disappointed it didn&#39;t work out, but even more disappointed that my first day out of my apartment has been a total mess in so many ways. I&#39;m ready to go home and take a shower.</p><p>“I’d like a moment with my client,” Corey says, standing up quickly.</p><p>Amanda nods, closing her briefcase as they both stand. “We’ll step out,” she says. “The details are in your folders. We have two other writers in mind if this doesn’t seem like a good fit for you, so please let us know something by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.”</p><p>Jeremy is the only one still sitting. He hasn&#39;t said a single word this whole time. Amanda leans forward to shake my hand. “If you have any questions, please ask. I’m happy to help.”</p><p>“Thank you,” I say. Amanda and Goddammit Barron walk out, but Jeremy keeps staring at me. Corey looks back and forth between us, waiting for Jeremy to leave. Instead, Jeremy leans forward, focusing on me.</p><p>“Could we possibly talk alone for a moment?” Jeremy asks me. He looks at Corey, but not to ask permission—it&#39;s more like he&#39;s telling him to leave.</p><p>Corey stares back at Jeremy, surprised by his bold request. I can tell by the way Corey slowly turns his head and squints that he wants me to say no. He’s practically saying, “Can you believe this guy?”</p><p>What he doesn&#39;t know is that I really want to be alone in this room with Jeremy. I want them all out of this room, especially Corey, because I suddenly have so many more questions for Jeremy. About his wife, about why they contacted me, about why she can&#39;t finish her own series anymore.</p><p>“It’s fine,” I tell Corey.</p><p>The vein in his forehead pops out as he tries to hide how annoyed he is. His jaw tightens, but he gives in and finally leaves the conference room.</p><p>It’s just Jeremy and me.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Including the elevator, this is the third time we’ve been alone together since we ran into each other this morning. But this is the first time I’ve felt this nervous. I’m sure it’s all me. Jeremy looks just as calm as he did when he was helping me clean bits of a person off of me less than an hour ago.</p><p>Jeremy leans back in his chair and rubs his hands down his face. “Jesus,” he says quietly. “Are meetings with publishers always this awkward?”</p><p>I laugh softly. “I wouldn’t know. I usually do these things over email.”</p><p>“I can see why.” He gets up and grabs a bottle of water. Maybe it’s because I’m sitting and he’s so tall, but I don’t remember feeling this small around him before. Knowing he’s married to Verity Crawford makes me feel even more intimidated than I did when I was standing in front of him in my skirt and bra.</p><p>He stays standing and leans against the counter, crossing his legs at the ankles. “Are you okay? You didn’t really have much time to get used to what happened across the street before coming in here.”</p><p>“Neither did you.”</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot; <em>There&#39;s that word again</em>. &quot;I&#39;m sure you have questions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A lot,&quot; I say.</p><p>&quot;What do you want to know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why can&#39;t your wife finish the series?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She was in a car accident,&quot; he says. He sounds like a robot, like he&#39;s trying not to feel anything right now.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t know.&quot; I move around in my seat, not sure what else to say.</p><p>&quot;At first, I didn&#39;t want anyone else to finish her contract. I was hoping she would get better. But—&quot; He stops. &quot;Here we are.&quot;</p><p>His behavior makes sense now. He seemed a little distant and quiet, but now I see that all the quiet parts of him are just sadness. Real sadness. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of what happened to his wife, or what he told me in the bathroom earlier—that his daughter died a few months ago. But this man is clearly not comfortable here, and he&#39;s dealing with decisions that are harder than anything most people ever have to deal with. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;</p><p>He nods, but doesn&#39;t say anything else. He goes back to his seat, which makes me wonder if he thinks I&#39;m still thinking about the offer. I don&#39;t want to waste more of his time than I already have.</p><p>&quot;I appreciate the offer, Jeremy, but honestly, I&#39;m not comfortable with it. I&#39;m not good with attention. I&#39;m not even sure why your wife&#39;s publisher contacted me as an option in the first place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Open Ended,&quot; Jeremy says.</p><p>I tense up when he mentions one of the books I wrote.</p><p>&quot;It was one of Verity&#39;s favorite books.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your wife read one of my books?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She said you were going to be the next big thing. I&#39;m the one who told her editor about you because Verity thought your writing styles were alike. If anyone is going to continue Verity&#39;s series, I want it to be someone whose work she respects.&quot;</p><p>I shake my head. &quot;Wow. I&#39;m honored, but...I can&#39;t.&quot;</p><p>Jeremy watches me without a word, probably wondering why I&#39;m not reacting the way most writers would to this chance. He can&#39;t understand me. Usually, I&#39;d be proud of that. I don&#39;t like being easy to read, but it feels wrong in this situation. I feel like I should be more open, just because he was nice to me this morning. But I wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin.</p><p>Jeremy leans forward, his eyes full of curiosity. He looks at me for a moment, then taps his fist on the table as he stands. I think the meeting is over and start to stand too, but Jeremy doesn&#39;t go toward the door. He goes toward a wall covered with framed awards, so I sit back down. He looks at the awards, with his back to me. It&#39;s not until he runs his fingers over one of them that I realize it&#39;s one of his wife&#39;s. He sighs and then turns to face me again.</p><p>&quot;Have you ever heard of people called Chronics?&quot; he asks.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>&quot;I think Verity might have made that term up. After our daughters died, she said we were Chronics. Likely to have chronic tragedy. Just one bad thing after another.&quot;</p><p>I stare at him for a moment, letting his words sink in. He said he lost a daughter before, but he&#39;s saying &quot;daughters.&quot; &quot;Daughters?&quot;</p><p>He takes a deep breath. He lets it out, sounding defeated. &quot;Yeah. Twins. We lost Chastin six months before Harper died. It&#39;s been...&quot; He&#39;s not hiding his emotions as well as he was before. He rubs his hand down his face and goes back to his chair. &quot;Some families are lucky enough to never have a single tragedy. But then there are those families that seem to have tragedies waiting to happen. Whatever can go wrong, does go wrong. And then it gets worse.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s telling me this, but I don&#39;t ask. I like hearing him talk, even if he&#39;s saying sad things.</p><p>He&#39;s spinning his water bottle on the table, looking down at it, lost in thought. I get the feeling he didn&#39;t ask to be alone with me to change my mind. He just wanted to be alone. Maybe he couldn&#39;t stand talking about his wife that way for another second, and he wanted them all to leave. I find that comforting—that being alone with me still feels like being alone to him.</p><p>Or maybe he always feels alone. Like our old neighbor who, from what it sounds like, was definitely a Chronic.</p><p>&quot;I grew up in Richmond,&quot; I say. &quot;Our neighbor lost his entire family in less than two years. His son died in combat. His wife died six months later from cancer. Then his daughter died in a car accident.&quot;</p><p>Jeremy stops moving the water bottle and pushes it away a little. &quot;Where&#39;s the man now?&quot;</p><p>I tense up. I wasn&#39;t expecting that question.</p><p>The truth is, the man couldn&#39;t handle losing everyone he loved. He killed himself a few months after his daughter died, but saying that to Jeremy, who is still grieving the deaths of his own daughters, would be awful.</p><p>&quot;He still lives in the same town. He got remarried a few years later and has some stepkids and grandkids now.”</p><p>There’s something in Jeremy’s face that makes me think he knows I’m lying, but he seems grateful that I did.</p><p>“You’ll need to spend time in Verity’s office, looking through her stuff. She has years of notes and outlines—things I wouldn’t know how to understand.”</p><p>I shake my head. <em>Did he not hear anything I said?</em> “Jeremy, I told you, I can’t—”</p><p>“The lawyer is offering you too little. Tell your agent to ask for half a million. Tell them you’ll do it without any publicity, using a fake name, and with a strong agreement to keep things secret. That way, whatever you’re trying to hide can stay hidden.”</p><p>I want to tell him I’m not trying to hide anything except feeling awkward, but before I can say anything, he’s moving toward the door.</p><p>“We live in Vermont,” he goes on. “I’ll give you the address after you sign the contract. You’re welcome to stay for as long as it takes to go through her office.”</p><p>He stops with his hand on the door. I start to object again, but the only word I can get out is a hesitant “<em>Alright</em>.”</p><p>He stares at me for a moment, like he has more to say. Then he says, “Alright.”</p><p>He opens the door and walks out into the hallway where Corey is waiting. Corey slips past him, back into the conference room, and closes the door.</p><p>I look down at the table, puzzled by what just happened. I&#39;m confused about why I&#39;m being offered so much money for a job I&#39;m not even sure I can handle. <em>Half a million dollars? And I can write under a different name without having to do book tours or any publicity?</em> <em>What did I say that made him offer that?</em></p><p>“I don’t like him,” Corey says, dropping into his seat. “What did he say to you?”</p><p>“He said they were offering too little and that I should ask for half a million with no publicity.”</p><p>I turn to see Corey gasp. He grabs my water bottle and takes a drink. “Wow.”</p></main></body></html>
