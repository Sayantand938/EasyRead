One of my heels doesn’t quite make it over the curb, so I grab the pole of a &quot;No Parking&quot; sign to steady myself.</p><p>The man was right in front of me just a few seconds ago. We were standing in a crowd waiting for the crosswalk light to change when he stepped into the street too soon, and a truck hit him. I reached out to try and stop him, but I grabbed at the air as he fell. I closed my eyes before his head went under the tire, but I heard it pop like a champagne cork.</p><p>He was at fault, casually looking down at his phone, probably because he&#39;d crossed the same street many times without anything happening. Death by routine.</p><p>People gasp, but no one screams. The passenger of the truck jumps out and immediately kneels near the man’s body. I step away from the scene as several people rush forward to help. I don’t have to look at the man under the tire to know he didn’t survive. I only have to look down at my once-white shirt—at the blood now splattered across it—to know that a hearse would be better for him than an ambulance.</p><p>I turn around to get away from the accident—to find a place to breathe—but the crosswalk sign now says &quot;walk,&quot; and the large crowd starts moving, making it impossible for me to go against the flow in this Manhattan river. Some people don’t even look up from their cell phones as they walk right by the accident. I stop trying to move and wait for the crowd to thin out. I glance back toward the accident, careful not to look directly at the man. The driver of the truck is now at the back of the vehicle, wide-eyed, on a cell phone. Three or four people are helping them. Some are led by their morbid curiosity, filming the awful scene with their phones.</p><p>If I were still living in Virginia, this would play out very differently. Everyone around would stop. Panic would break out, people would be screaming, and a news crew would be there in minutes. But here in Manhattan, a pedestrian getting hit by a vehicle happens so often that it’s not much more than an inconvenience. A traffic delay for some, a ruined outfit for others. This probably happens so often that it won’t even make the news.</p><p>As much as the indifference of some of the people here bothers me, it’s exactly why I moved to this city ten years ago. People like me belong in overpopulated cities. The state of my life doesn&#39;t matter as much in a place this big. There are far more people here with stories much sadder than mine.</p><p>Here, I’m invisible. Unimportant. Manhattan is too crowded to care about me, and I love it for that.</p><p>“Are you hurt?”</p><p>I look up at a man as he touches my arm and looks at my shirt. He looks really worried as he checks me for injuries. I can tell he isn&#39;t one of those tough New Yorkers. He might live here now, but wherever he&#39;s from, it&#39;s a place that didn&#39;t completely get rid of his empathy.</p><p>&quot;Are you hurt?&quot; the stranger asks again, looking me in the eye.</p><p>&quot;No. It&#39;s not my blood. I was standing close to him when…&quot; I stop talking. <em>I just saw a man die.</em> I was so close to him, his blood is on me.</p><p>I moved to this city to blend in, but I&#39;m definitely not tough. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been trying to become—as tough as the concrete under my feet. It hasn&#39;t been going very well. I can feel everything I just saw sitting heavy in my stomach.</p><p>I cover my mouth with my hand, but quickly pull it away when I feel something sticky on my lips. <em>More blood</em>. I look down at my shirt. So much blood, and none of it is mine. I grab my shirt and pull it away from my chest, but it sticks to my skin where the blood is starting to dry.</p><p>I think I need water. I&#39;m starting to feel dizzy, and I want to rub my forehead, pinch my nose, but I&#39;m scared to touch myself. I look up at the man who is still holding my arm.</p><p>&quot;Is it on my face?&quot; I ask him.</p><p>He presses his lips together and then looks away, checking out the street around us. He points toward a coffee shop a few doors down.</p><p>&quot;They&#39;ll have a bathroom,&quot; he says, putting his hand on my lower back as he leads me that way.</p><p>I look across the street at the Pantem Press building I was going to before the accident. I was so close. Fifteen—maybe twenty—feet away from a meeting I really need to be in.</p><p>I wonder how close the man who just passed away was to where he was going.</p><p>The stranger holds the door for me when we get to the coffee shop. A woman with a coffee in each hand tries to squeeze past me through the doorway until she sees my shirt. She quickly backs away from me, letting us both go inside. I head toward the women’s restroom, but it’s locked. The man pushes open the door to the men’s restroom and motions for me to come in.</p><p>He doesn’t lock the door after us. He walks to the sink and turns on the water. I look in the mirror, relieved that it isn’t as bad as I thought. There are a few splatters of blood on my cheeks that are starting to darken and dry, and some above my eyebrows. But thankfully, the shirt took most of it.</p><p>The man hands me wet paper towels, and I wipe my face while he wets some more. I can smell the blood now. The sharp smell makes me think back to when I was ten. The smell of blood was so strong that I still remember it after all these years.</p><p>I try to hold my breath as I start to feel sick again. I don’t want to throw up. But I want this shirt off me. Right now.</p><p>My fingers tremble as I unbutton it, then I take it off and put it under the faucet. I let the water do its job while I take the other wet napkins from the stranger and start wiping the blood off my chest.</p><p>He goes to the door, but instead of giving me privacy while I’m standing here in my least attractive bra, he locks us in the bathroom so no one will walk in while I’m shirtless. It’s strangely polite and makes me feel uncomfortable. I’m tense as I watch him in the mirror.</p><p>Someone knocks.</p><p>“Just a minute,” he says.</p><p>I relax a little, feeling better knowing that someone outside this door would hear me if I screamed.</p><p>I focus on washing the blood off my neck and chest until I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all gone. Then, I check my hair in the mirror, turning my head from side to side, and see only about an inch of dark roots above my fading caramel color.</p><p>&quot;Here,&quot; the man says, as he unbuttons his crisp white shirt. &quot;Put this on.&quot;</p><p>He&#39;s already taken off his suit jacket, which is now hanging on the doorknob. He takes off his button-up shirt, showing a white undershirt underneath. He&#39;s muscular and taller than me. His shirt will be huge on me. I can&#39;t wear this to my meeting, but I don&#39;t have another choice. I take the shirt when he gives it to me. I grab a few more dry paper towels and pat my skin, then put on his shirt and start buttoning it. It looks ridiculous, but at least it wasn&#39;t my head that exploded on someone else’s shirt. Silver lining.</p><p>I take my wet shirt out of the sink and realize I can&#39;t save it. I throw it in the trash, then grip the sink and stare at myself in the mirror. Two tired, empty eyes stare back. The horror of what I just saw has made my hazel eyes a murky brown. I rub my cheeks with my palms to try to get some color in them, but it doesn&#39;t work. I look like death.</p><p>I lean against the wall, turning away from the mirror. The man is crumpling up his tie. He shoves it in his suit pocket and looks me over. &quot;I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re calm or in shock.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m not in shock, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m calm either. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I say. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#39;ve seen worse, sadly.&quot;</p><p>I tilt my head, trying to understand his mysterious answer. He looks away, which just makes me stare harder, wondering what he&#39;s seen that&#39;s worse than a man&#39;s head being crushed by a truck. Maybe he really is a New Yorker. Or maybe he works in a hospital. He seems competent, like someone who&#39;s in charge of other people.</p><p>&quot;Are you a doctor?&quot;</p><p>He shakes his head. &quot;I&#39;m in real estate. Or I used to be.&quot; He steps closer and reaches for my shoulder, brushing something off my shirt. His shirt. When he drops his arm, he looks at my face for a moment before stepping back.</p><p>His eyes match the bright green tie he just stuffed in his pocket. He&#39;s good-looking, but something about him makes me think he wishes he wasn&#39;t. Almost like his looks are a problem for him. A part of him he doesn&#39;t want anyone to see. He wants to disappear in this city, just like me.</p><p>Most people come to New York to get noticed. The rest of us come here to hide.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; he asks.</p><p>&quot;Lowen.&quot;</p><p>He pauses for a moment after I say my name, but it&#39;s only for a couple of seconds.</p><p>&quot;Jeremy,&quot; he says. He goes to the sink and turns on the water again, and starts washing his hands. I keep staring at him, unable to stop being curious. What did he mean when he said he&#39;s seen worse than the accident we just saw? He said he used to be in real estate, but even the worst day as a realtor wouldn&#39;t fill someone with the kind of sadness that&#39;s filling this man.</p><p>&quot;What happened to you?&quot; I ask.</p><p>He looks at me in the mirror. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You said you&#39;ve seen worse. What have you seen?&quot;</p><p>He turns off the water and dries his hands, then looks at me. &quot;You really want to know?&quot;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>He throws the paper towel away and puts his hands in his pockets. He seems even more down than before. He looks me in the eye, but he seems distant. “I pulled my eight-year-old daughter’s body out of a lake five months ago.”</p><p>I gasp and touch my throat. <em>It wasn’t gloom on his face at all. It was despair.</em> “I’m so sorry,” I whisper. And I truly am. Sorry about his daughter. Sorry for being so curious.</p><p>“What about you?” he asks. He leans against the counter like he’s ready for this talk. Like he’s been waiting for it. Someone to come along and make his tragedies seem less awful. It’s what you do when you’ve been through the worst. You look for people like you…people who are worse off…and you use them to feel better about the terrible things that have happened to you.</p><p>I swallow before I answer, because my problems are nothing compared to his. I think of the most recent one, and I&#39;m embarrassed to say it because it seems so small compared to his. “My mother died last week.”</p><p>He doesn’t react to my tragedy the way I reacted to his. He doesn’t react at all, and I wonder if it’s because he wanted mine to be worse. It isn’t. <em>He wins.</em></p><p>“How did she die?”</p><p>“Cancer. I’ve been taking care of her in my apartment for the past year.” He’s the first person I’ve said that to out loud. I can feel my pulse racing in my wrist, so I grab it with my other hand. “Today is the first time I’ve left my apartment in weeks.”</p><p>We stare at each other for a moment. I want to say something else, but I’ve never had such a serious talk with a total stranger before. I kind of want it to be over, because where do we even go from here?</p><p>It doesn’t go anywhere. It just stops.</p><p>He looks at himself in the mirror again, pushing a loose strand of dark hair back. “I have a meeting to get to. Are you sure you’ll be okay?” He&#39;s looking at me in the mirror.</p><p>“Yes. I’m alright.”</p><p>“Alright?” He turns, repeating the word like a question, as if being alright isn’t as good as being okay.</p><p>“I’ll be alright,” I repeat. “Thank you for the help.”</p><p>I want him to smile, but it doesn’t feel right. I wonder what his smile would look like. Instead, he shrugs a little and says, “Alright, then.” He goes to unlock the door and holds it open for me, but I don’t leave right away. I keep watching him, not ready to face the outside world. I appreciate his kindness and want to say more, to thank him somehow, maybe over coffee or by giving him back his shirt. I’m drawn to his kindness—something rare these days. But then I see the wedding ring on his left hand, and I move forward, out of the bathroom and coffee shop, into the busy street.</p><p>An ambulance has arrived and is blocking traffic. I walk back toward the scene, wondering if I should give a statement. I wait near a cop who is writing down what other people saw. Their stories are the same as mine, but I give them my statement and my contact information. I don’t know how helpful my statement is, since I didn’t actually see him get hit. I was just close enough to hear it, and close enough to get covered in blood.</p><p>I look back and see Jeremy leaving the coffee shop with a fresh coffee. He crosses the street, focused on where he’s going. His mind is somewhere else now, far away from me, probably on his wife and what he&#39;ll say about his missing shirt.</p><p>I take my phone out of my purse and check the time. I still have fifteen minutes before my meeting with Corey and the editor from Pantem Press. My hands are shaking even more now that the stranger isn’t here to distract me. Coffee might help. Morphine would definitely help, but hospice took it all from my apartment last week when they picked up their equipment after my mother died. It’s too bad I didn’t hide some. I could really use some right now.</p></main></body></html>
