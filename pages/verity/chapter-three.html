But sometimes I wonder where I&#39;d be if I had gone along with what he wanted. Would we be married now? Would we have kids? Would he have moved on to even riskier sexual stuff?</p><p>I think that&#39;s what worried me the most about him. When you&#39;re in your early twenties, normal sex should be enough without bringing in fetishes so early in a relationship.</p><p>I like to think about Amos when I&#39;m feeling down about my life. As I look at the pink eviction notice in Corey&#39;s hand, I remind myself that things could be worse—I could still be with Amos.</p><p>I open my apartment door wider, letting Corey in. I didn&#39;t know he was coming, or I would have made sure there weren&#39;t any eviction notices taped to my door. It&#39;s the third day in a row I&#39;ve gotten one. I take it from him and stuff it in a drawer.</p><p>Corey holds up a champagne bottle. &quot;Thought we could celebrate the new contract,&quot; he says, handing me the bottle. I&#39;m glad he doesn&#39;t mention the eviction. It&#39;s not as bad now that I&#39;m about to get paid. What I&#39;ll do until then...I&#39;m not sure. I might have enough money for a few days in a hotel.</p><p>I can always sell what&#39;s left of my mother&#39;s things.</p><p>Corey has already taken off his coat and is loosening his tie. This used to be our routine, before my mother moved in. He&#39;d show up and start taking off his clothes until we were in bed together.</p><p>That stopped completely when I found out on social media that he had been on a few dates with a girl named Rebecca. I didn&#39;t stop sleeping with him because I was jealous—I stopped because I respected the girl who didn&#39;t know about it.</p><p>&quot;How&#39;s Becca?&quot; I ask as I open the cabinet to find two glasses. Corey&#39;s hand stops on his tie, like he&#39;s surprised I know about his love life. &quot;I write suspense novels, Corey. Don&#39;t be so shocked that I know all about your girlfriend.&quot;</p><p>I don’t wait to see what he thinks. I open the champagne and pour two glasses. When I turn to give Corey a glass, he’s sitting at the bar. I stay on the other side and we raise our glasses. But I put mine down before he can make a toast. I look down at my champagne, unable to think of anything to celebrate except the money.</p><p>“It’s not my show,” I say. “They aren’t my characters. And the writer who made these books popular is hurt. It feels wrong to toast to this.”</p><p>Corey’s glass is still in the air. He shrugs and then drinks his entire glass in one gulp, giving it back to me. “Don’t think about why you’re playing. Just think about winning.”</p><p>I roll my eyes as I put his empty glass in the sink.</p><p>“Have you even read one of her books?” he asks.</p><p>I shake my head and turn on the water. I should probably wash dishes. I have two days to leave this apartment, and I want to take my dishes with me. “Nope. Have you?” I put soap in the water and grab a sponge.</p><p>Corey laughs. “No. She’s not my kind of writer.”</p><p>I look up at him, just as he realizes that his words are also an insult to my writing. I got this job because Verity’s husband said our writing styles were similar.</p><p>“That’s not what I meant,” he says. He gets up and walks around the bar, standing next to me at the sink. He waits for me to finish cleaning a plate, and then he takes it and starts rinsing it. “It doesn’t look like you’ve packed anything. Have you found a new place yet?”</p><p>“I have a storage unit and I’m planning to move most of my stuff out by tomorrow. I applied at an apartment complex in Brooklyn, but they won’t have anything for two weeks.”</p><p>&quot;The eviction notice says you have two days to get out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, where are you going? To a hotel?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eventually. I&#39;m leaving Sunday for Verity Crawford&#39;s house. Her husband says I&#39;ll need to spend a day or two in her office before I start the series.&quot;</p><p>Right after I signed the contract this morning, I got an email from Jeremy with directions to their house. I asked to come on Sunday, and luckily he said yes.</p><p>Corey takes another dish from me. I can feel him looking at me. &quot;You&#39;re staying at their <em>house?</em>&quot;</p><p>&quot;How else am I going to get her notes for the series?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have him mail them to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She has thirteen years of notes and outlines. Jeremy said he wouldn&#39;t even know where to start, and it would be easier if I sorted through it myself.&quot;</p><p>Corey doesn&#39;t say anything, but I can tell he&#39;s holding back what he wants to say. I run the sponge down the knife in my hand and then give it to him.</p><p>“What are you holding back?” I ask.</p><p>He silently rinses the knife, puts it in the strainer, then grabs the edge of the sink and looks at me. “The guy lost two daughters. Then his wife gets hurt in a car accident. I&#39;m not really comfortable with you being in his house.”</p><p>The water suddenly feels too cold. I get chills. I turn off the water and dry my hands, leaning against the sink. “Are you saying he had something to do with any of it?”</p><p>Corey shrugs. “I don’t know enough about what happened to say anything for sure. But hasn&#39;t it crossed your mind? That maybe it’s not safe? You don’t even know them.”</p><p>I’m not stupid. I’ve been finding out everything I can about them online. Their first child was at a sleepover fifteen miles away when she had an allergic reaction. Neither Jeremy nor Verity was there when it happened. And the second daughter drowned in the lake behind their house, but Jeremy didn’t get home until the search for her body had already started. Both were called accidents. I can see why Corey is worried, because I was, too, honestly. But the more I look into it, the less worried I am. Two sad, separate accidents.</p><p>“And what about Verity’s car accident?”</p><p>“It was an accident,” I say. “She hit a tree.”</p><p>Corey’s face says he doesn’t believe it. “I read there weren’t any skid marks. Which means she either fell asleep or she did it on purpose.”</p><p>“Can you blame her?” I’m annoyed that he’s making things up. I turn around to finish the dishes. “She lost both of her daughters. Anyone who goes through something like that would want to escape.”</p><p>Corey dries his hands on the towel and then grabs his jacket off the barstool. “Accidents or not, the family clearly has bad luck and a lot of emotional problems, so you need to be careful. Go in, get what you need, and leave.”</p><p>&quot;How about you handle the contract stuff, Corey? I&#39;ll take care of the research and writing.&quot;</p><p>He puts on his jacket. &quot;Just trying to help you out.&quot;</p><p><em>Help me out?</em> He knew my mom was dying, and he hasn&#39;t even talked to me in two months. He&#39;s not helping me. He&#39;s just an ex who thought he was going to get lucky tonight, but instead, got turned down and then found out I&#39;ll be staying at another guy&#39;s house. He&#39;s just jealous and calling it concern.</p><p>I walk him to the door, happy he&#39;s leaving so soon. I don&#39;t blame him for wanting to get out of here. This apartment has had a strange feeling ever since my mom moved in. That&#39;s why I haven&#39;t even bothered fighting the lease or telling the landlord I&#39;ll have the money in two weeks. I want to leave this place even more than Corey does right now.</p><p>&quot;Anyway,&quot; he says, &quot;congrats. Whether you created this series or not, your writing got you here. You should be proud.&quot;</p><p><em>I hate it when he says nice things when I&#39;m already annoyed.</em> &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Text me as soon as you get there on Sunday.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And let me know if you need help moving.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I won&#39;t.&quot;</p><p>He chuckles a bit. “Okay, then.” He doesn&#39;t hug me when he says goodbye. He salutes me as he walks backward, and it&#39;s the most awkward goodbye we&#39;ve ever had. I have a feeling our relationship is now what it should be: Agent and author. Nothing else.</p></main></body></html>
